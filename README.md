# AnyOrbit
AnyOrbit is a powerful navigation algorithm for 3D virtual environments including virtual reality.  This repository contains a Unity project that you can get running straight away.

To get started, try downloading the "AnyOrbit stars demo.zip" file, unzip and load.  You can experience a guided tour around the brightest stars visible from Earth.  

Next try the "AnyOrbit mouse stars.zip" file. This one gives you control of the orbital center directly with using mouse input. Use the mouse scroll wheel to move the red marker away and towards you and around in your field of view.  This marker represents your orbital center of motion, or point of interest (POI).  Rotate your head to orbit around the star field.  Here is a video of the experience: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmzXvdzG9HQ

The stars are a sample of data of real stars visible from earth, a reference to the data set can be found in the papers written about AnyOrbit.

AnyOrbit may be a very useful navigation tool for 3D environments including for CAD, gaming, sports and e-sports spectating, and data visualisation. In addition to using the mouse to control the point of interest at the center of the orbital camera motion, we have also attempted use of eye-tracking, directed control, in augmented reality, and also in desktop situations, also using eye-tracking for point of interest selection.  Videos of some of these implementations can be found at my youtube channel.

A further note has been accepted for publication at ETRA, which details the technical implementation, which will be published soon.
